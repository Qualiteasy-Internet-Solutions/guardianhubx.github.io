faq_title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
faq_subtitle: "We answer the doubts our clients usually have before starting."
faq_items:
  - question: "I already have an antivirus installed, why do I need this?"
    answer: "**Antivirus protects your computer, we protect your identity.** An antivirus prevents viruses from entering your PC, but it cannot know if someone stole your password on the Dark Web, if they are spoofing your domain to scam your clients, or if there is an active fraud wave. They are complementary services: the antivirus is the lock on the door, **GuardianRadar is the alarm and security cameras**."
  - question: "Will you read my emails or see my files?"
    answer: "**Absolutely NOT.** We do not install anything on your computer nor do we have access to your inbox. We watch **from the outside**: we track the internet and leaked databases looking for your email address or domain. If something appears out there, that's when we warn you."
  - question: "I'm not technical at all, will I know how to use it?"
    answer: "**If you know how to use WhatsApp, you know how to use GuardianRadar.** You don't have to configure complex control panels. If we detect a danger, you get a message on your mobile explaining what is happening and which button to press to solve it. And if you have doubts, you reply on WhatsApp and a human helps you."
  - question: "What happens if I receive a suspicious email from the Tax Office, Post Office, or a bank?"
    answer: "This is our clients' favorite part. Before clicking, **take a screenshot and send it to us via WhatsApp.** Our team will analyze it instantly and tell you: *'It's a scam, delete it'* or *'It's legitimate, you can open it'*. It's like having a cybersecurity expert in your pocket."
  - question: "Will the price go up after the first year?"
    answer: "The current offer (9.99€ or 29.99€) is a special launch price for the first 50 clients. If you sign up now, **we keep this price for the first 12 months**. After that, renewal is at the standard price, but we will notify you in advance, and you can cancel if you wish."
  - question: "How does the 100€ 'Technical Report' work and when do I need it?"
    answer: "The monthly service monitors your identity. The **Technical Report** is a deep, one-time audit of your website: we check if your domain is misconfigured (DNS, DMARC), if you have open ports, or if your SSL certificate is vulnerable. We recommend requesting it once a year or if you have just launched a new website."
