- question: "What exactly is phishing?"
  answer: "Phishing is an attack that impersonates legitimate entities (banks, companies, colleagues) through fraudulent emails, messages, or phone calls to obtain confidential information such as passwords, bank data, or access to systems. It is the most common entry vector for cyberattacks, initiating 91% of successful attacks."
- question: "What is the difference between phishing, smishing, and vishing?"
  answer: "Phishing uses email, smishing uses SMS/mobile messaging, and vishing uses phone calls. All share the same objective: manipulating through social engineering. Vishing is particularly effective because voice generates more trust than email, especially when using technology to clone a superior's voice."
- question: "What is CEO fraud and why is it so dangerous?"
  answer: "CEO fraud (BEC - Business Email Compromise) is an attack targeting employees with payment access, impersonating the CEO. The attacker requests an urgent transfer leveraging hierarchical pressure. It is dangerous because it causes direct and immediate financial losses, often unrecoverable. In 2025, millions of euros were stolen across Europe using this technique."
- question: "How can I identify a phishing email?"
  answer: "Look for red flags: extreme urgency, confidentiality requests, suspicious links, grammatical errors, slightly different email addresses, password requests, unexpected attachments. Verify sender details, hover your cursor over links without clicking, and when in doubt, contact the company directly by phone."
- question: "Why is training more important than just technology?"
  answer: "Because phishing exploits the human factor, not technical vulnerabilities. The most advanced antivirus won't detect a malicious link if you click on it. Training and simulations convert your team into the first line of defense, teaching them to recognize red flags and create a security culture."
- question: "What is a phishing simulation and how does it work?"
  answer: "A phishing simulation is the controlled sending of fraudulent emails to measure your team's vulnerability without real risk. If an employee falls for it, they receive an 'educational moment' explaining what they should have noticed. It is the most effective tool for training the human factor in a practical way."
- question: "What should I do if I fall for a phishing attack?"
  answer: "Act quickly following the I.C.E.R. model: Identify what information was compromised, Contain by blocking access to accounts, Eradicate malware, Recover from backups. Notify your IT team, change passwords immediately, alert your bank if financial data is compromised, and report the incident to INCIBE (017)."

      <p class="mb-3 landing-text-muted">Phishing is a social engineering attack that impersonates legitimate entities (banks, companies, colleagues) to obtain confidential information or access to systems.</p>
      <p class="mb-3 landing-text-muted">Attackers use emails that appear genuine, including logos, designs, and language identical to the original brand. They include malicious links or attachments that, if you click on them, compromise your device or steal your credentials.</p>
      <p class="mb-4 landing-text-muted">The most dangerous thing about phishing is that <strong>it does not require technical vulnerabilities</strong>. It exploits human psychology: urgency, trust, fear, and authority. This is why it is the most effective entry point for ransomware, malware, and data theft.</p>
